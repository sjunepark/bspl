## Todo

- Remap all `function id`
- Parsing html only works for one bspl. Need to fix the whole logic. Have to decide the data structure first.
- Check if `inspect_err`s are necessary

## Pending

- Use newtypes for DB structs.
    - The [pull request](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/pull/1779) has to be merged first due to bug in
      `libsql`.
